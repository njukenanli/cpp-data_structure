This repository includes some data structure headers written in cpp, especially for those not included in cpp std lib, like graph and union-find set. (As a matter of fact, priority queue in std lib is written with heap, set/map with RB-Tree and unordered set/map with Hash Table, so these data structures can be used with std lib directly.)

You can borrow my code and make your own modifications.

I wrote 2 example programmes for Kruskal algorithm and Kosaraju algorithm. A test case is included in each example file. You can modify the macro definitions in main.cpp to run one of them.
