This repository includes some data structure headers written in cpp, especially for those not included in cpp std lib, like graph and union-find set.
You can borrow my code and make your own modifications.
I wrote 2 example programmes for Kruskal algorithm and Kosaraju algorithm. A test case is included in each example file. You can modify the macro definitions in main.cpp to run one of them.
